# Udacity Project 2 : Investigate a dataset 

This was my second project in my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree . The aim of this project was to utilize the basic cleaning and ploting function required to analyse a dataset and draw
insights from it . Out of the given option for the project I selected to work on Kaggle's No show data set in which people who are no show for doctors appointment in Brazil are tracket .
I was expected to fix the quality issues in the dataset and then using matplotlib and pandas plot visulization to draw insights from it . 

I am also placing the dataset used in the repository. So that anyone intrested can run my jupyter notebook.
